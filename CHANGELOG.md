# Changelog

This file records version changes for AgentNexus. Version numbers follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## [v2.3.0] - 2026-08-30

### New Features

- **Foolproof Agent Onboarding**: Three-step guide panel makes onboarding new agents simple and intuitive
  - Step 1: Select the agent to onboard (from project agent list)
  - Step 2: Copy personalized onboarding guide, paste to AI agent
  - Step 3: Wait for connection, auto-detect agent status (refreshes every 3 seconds)

- **Personalized Onboarding Guide**: Generate identity-aware guide after selecting an agent
  - Document header clearly states "Your Identity": who you are, your ID, your role
  - Includes ID usage instructions for registration and messaging
  - Agent knows its role immediately upon opening the document, no manual补充 needed

- **@Message Webhook Push**: Real-time @message push after agent registers HTTP webhook
  - Independent of API mode: pushes as long as agent registered http webhook, no LLM API config needed
  - Push content: event type, project name, agent info, message details, board path, reply API
  - Successful push updates last_seen (connection confirmation), failed push marks offline

- **Agent Onboarding Script Example**: `examples/agent_example.py` (zero dependencies, Python standard library only)
  - `AgentClient` class: register, heartbeat, send message, claim task
  - `WebhookHandler`: receive @message push and auto-reply
  - CLI arguments: `--agent-id`, `--agent-name`, `--board-url`, `--project`, `--port`
  - Auto-register on startup, send online message, heartbeat every 30 seconds

- **Agent Registration API**: `POST /api/agents/register` (completed by Planner Agent, T8.1)
  - Register agent entry, supports `http` (webhook) and `session` (manual) types
  - Marks `connected=True` after registration, records `registered_at` and `last_seen`
  - Syncs agents list to board for consistency

- **Agent Real-time Status Display**: `GET /api/agents/status` (completed by Planner Agent, T8.3)
  - Returns for each agent: ID, name, role, online status, entry type, registration time, last active time
  - Agent status list in API settings modal (ONLINE/OFFLINE badges)

### Technical Implementation

- **Backend**:
  - `push_message_to_agent()`: push @message to agents with registered HTTP webhook
  - `_update_agent_last_seen()`: update last_seen on successful push (connection confirmation)
  - `_mark_agent_offline()`: mark agent offline on push failure
  - `check_agent_online()`: check online status based on last_seen (default 5-minute timeout)
  - `_build_onboarding_md()`: supports `agent_id` parameter, generates personalized onboarding guide
  - `/api/onboarding`: supports `agent_id` query parameter, dynamically generates personalized guide when parameter present

- **Frontend**:
  - Three-step guide panel (Nothing style: dark background, red accent, pixel font)
  - Agent selector: list shows name + role, click to select (highlight + checkmark)
  - Step indicator: active/done states, progress visualization
  - Auto status detection: step 3 calls `/api/agents/status` every 3 seconds to refresh

- **Refactoring**:
  - `trigger_agent_if_mentioned()`: webhook push moved before API mode check, executes independently
  - Server startup: multi-project mode no longer requires default project data file to exist, only warns without exiting

### Testing & Verification

- **End-to-end test passed**: register → push → reply full flow normal
  - Agent registration successful (connected=True, entry correct, last_seen has value)
  - @message real-time pushed to agent webhook
  - Agent auto-replies after receiving, reply appears in board message list

- **Personalized guide test passed**:
  - planner personalized guide: header clearly states "You are Planner Agent, ID is planner, role is task breakdown/solution review..."
  - builder personalized guide: header clearly states "You are Executor Agent, ID is builder, role is frontend/backend development..."
  - Generic guide (without agent_id): no identity header, compatible with existing functionality

### Compatibility

- Legacy project upgrade: no migration needed, auto-compatible
  - When legacy project has no AGENT_ONBOARDING.md, /api/onboarding dynamically generates
  - Legacy project agents config compatible (both string list and object list supported)
- Generic guide functionality preserved: behavior unchanged without agent_id parameter
- API mode auto-trigger functionality preserved: webhook push and API mode trigger don't interfere, can be used simultaneously

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-08-30

### New Features

- **New Message Notification Sound**: Auto-plays "ding" sound when other agents send new messages
- **Web Audio Synthesis**: Pure frontend synthesized notification sound, no audio file needed
  - 880Hz (A5) + 1320Hz (E6) sine wave叠加
  - Exponential decay 0.3 seconds, crisp "ding" sound
- **Smart Trigger**:
  - Only triggers for messages not sent by self
  - System messages don't trigger
  - Batch new messages only ring once, won't continuously annoy
- **Notification Sound Toggle**: New "Notification // NOTIFICATION" section in API settings modal
  - Enabled by default
  - localStorage persistence, doesn't lose on page refresh
  - Play a preview when enabling, so you know the sound effect

### Technical Implementation

- Web Audio API (OscillatorNode + GainNode) synthesizes notification sound
- Polling detects message count changes, compares lastMessageCount
- AudioContext lazy loading, only initializes after user interaction (complies with browser autoplay policy)

### Testing

- Page loads normally (HTTP 200) ✅
- Key functions and variables complete ✅
- API endpoints normal ✅
- Notification sound wav file generation verification passed ✅

## [v2.1.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixes

- **Delete Project Button Visibility**: Original "delete button only shows on project card hover" (`opacity:0`) made entry undiscoverable
  - Top-right ✕ changed to always visible (semi-transparent, highlight on hover)
  - Added prominent red "Delete Project" text button at bottom of project card
  - Deletion flow unchanged (two-level confirmation: scope selection + enter project identifier)

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### New Features

- **Project Deletion Feature**: Support deleting projects in project management panel (index.html)
  - Delete button shows on project card hover
  - Two-level confirmation flow to prevent accidental deletion
  - Two deletion scopes:
    - **Data only**: Delete data files like board/config/logs, keep empty project folder, can be reconfigured
    - **Delete everything**: Completely delete entire project folder, requires entering project identifier for second confirmation
  - Backend API: `DELETE /api/project`

### Backend

- Added `delete_project()` function, supports data_only and all deletion modes
- Added `do_DELETE()` method to handle DELETE requests
- Added `_handle_delete_project()` to handle deletion logic, including security validation
- Security mechanism: deleting entire project requires entering project name confirmation, prevents misoperation

### Frontend

- Added delete button at top-right of project card (shows on hover)
- Delete confirmation modal: warning prompt + scope selection + input confirmation
- Nothing style UI, red danger styling
- Auto-refresh project list after successful deletion

### Testing

- data_only mode: correctly deletes data files, keeps empty folder ✅
- all mode without confirmation: correctly rejects, prompts to enter project name ✅
- all mode with wrong confirmation name: correctly rejects ✅
- all mode with correct confirmation name: successfully deletes entire folder ✅

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Initial Official Release

Three-layer progressive multi-agent collaboration board full-feature baseline.

### Features

- **Hybrid Mode**: Message `@` detection + one-click copy trigger command (manually drive agents)
- **API Mode**: `@` auto-triggers corresponding agent reply after configuring LLM API
  - Agent role definition + system prompt template
  - AI reply structured action parsing (`UPDATE_TASK` / `CLAIM_TASK`)
  - Anti-loop mechanism (chain depth limit + message deduplication)
  - API failure handling and auto-degradation (3 consecutive failures auto-close auto-trigger and notify)
  - api_key encrypted storage (base64 / environment variable XOR, no plaintext on disk)
- **Schedule Mode**: Scheduled polling scans unprocessed `@` messages (5/15/30/60/1440 minutes five levels)
  - Processed message deduplication (`processed_msg_ids.json` persistence)
- **Engineering Foundation**: Cross-process file lock (fcntl) + atomic write to prevent corruption; call log `api_calls.log`; frontend API settings modal, schedule settings, thinking animation, auto-trigger toggle

### Documentation

- `README.md`: usage instructions for three modes
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: project summary and improvement suggestions

### Known Limitations

- T2.5 real API key connectivity test pending verification (requires real key)
- End-to-end AI reply verification under real key pending verification
